                    <h2><b>The Greater works generation</b></h2>
                    <p>
                        I celebrate and appreciate the efforts and contributions of all the legends and
                        heroes that have gone ahead of us in all fields of human endeavours. Their works
                        have added beauty to life and made the world more comfortable for us to dwell.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, I am glad I belong to this generation; a generation of people who
                        will make their legendary works look like 'CHILD'S-PLAY'. By this, I do not mean
                        to despise or belittled their works in any way, but I am only giving amplification
                        to the WORD of GOD which says that the latter house shall be greater than the former.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoin all the youths in the house not to be intimidated by their legendary
                        works, they have simply succeeded in doing what we couldn't have been able to do so
                        we can do what they wouldn't have been able to do. They have done their part and they
                        did it well. It's time we do our own part and do it pretty well.
                        Let's arise; wake up from our sleep and slumber, take responsibility and let's make
                        the world a better place.
